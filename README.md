#Introduction
World of Horror Modding allows users to add extra events, characters, etc. to their World of Horror gaming experience. While there are several different things you can add, we will stick with a custom event for now. Furthermore, this will assume that you are using Windows 10 and have World of Horror on your PC.

##Steps

###Create a text document

* Right click on your screen and create a new text document. Name it however you wish, but be sure to keep it relevant to what type of event you are going for.
* Make sure that the file type is saved as ".ito"  For example, you might name it "Seller.ito" . If you do not save it as a ".ito" file, the mod will not work when you boot up World of Horror

###Edit your Document
